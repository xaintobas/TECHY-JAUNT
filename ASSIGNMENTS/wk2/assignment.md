Assignment Details
You are to conceptualize and implement a basic (but not overly simplistic) CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application utilizing the Express framework in conjunction with MongoDB as your database solution.

The application should incorporate environmental variable management through the use of dotenv, and employ Morgan as a middleware for request logging and debugging insights, but ensure that your configuration avoids exposing sensitive credentials (yet everything must still function locally).

After successful implementation, the entirety of your project directory should be version-controlled and pushed to GitHub, with a well-documented README.md file that not only explains what you built, but also why you structured it that way (even if the reason is simply “it worked”).

In your README, include sections describing:

Your folder structure and rationale (even if improvised)

Environment variable setup instructions

How to run the application locally

Any assumptions you made that made sense at 2 a.m. while debugging

Finally, submit only your GitHub repository link, not a ZIP file, not a screenshot, not your dreams, just the link.

⚠️ Hint: If your .env file appears on GitHub, your grade may mysteriously vanish.
